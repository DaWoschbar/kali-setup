# kali-setup script
A little script setting up my kali environment including the tools and repository I use the most. 


# Latest implementations & Improvements
The script has been improved and now supports two essential features, which will enrich your life by a lot:

## Profile mode
In order to make this script more versatile, I decided to take out some parts of the code and put them into an external file allow to use profiles. This way every person is able to import their own shell environment as well as to perform their own tasks individually. 

Profiles can be executed via the `-p` or `--profile` flag and require the foldername as parameter, which must have the `profile.hs` script.

The `profile.sh` script will then be executed.

## OwO mode
Essential mode which will brigthen your day. It fullfils all requirements as per the geneva conventions. 

## Script Usage
